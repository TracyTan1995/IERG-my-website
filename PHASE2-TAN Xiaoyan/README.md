## README file of phase 2B
##### The project mainly include 2 parts:
* The layout of the website
* The admin panel of the website
******
##### You can get into the two parts through the following URLs:
* The mainpage of the website: 18.224.209.219
* The admin panel of the website: 18.224.209.219/admin.php
*******
##### What I did in this project:
1. Edit the SQL as cart.db and uploaded it
2. Make the admin panel using php
3. Add functions into the admin panel, like insert new products/categories, delete products/categories, seach products/categories, edit products/categories.
4. Rewrite the mainpage using php, so that it can show the categories and products dynamically.
